# modern-cmake-sample
this is my version of a cmake project (using OpenGL, GLUT, GLFW and GLAD) for demonstration.

Building: create a build directory in the cloned directory, navigate into the build directory, then run "$ cmake .." and from there on "$ make" inside the build folder to build the project.
